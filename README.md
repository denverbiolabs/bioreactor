Welcome to the bioreactor wiki!

This is an Open Source project created by Denver Biolabs. Feel free to browse around for more information and learn about our design process. 

A note about the Biotools group within Denver Biolabs:

We are a group of DIYbio enthusiasts comprised of diverse and cross-disciplinary backgrounds in the biological sciences, computer science, data science, art, communication, citizen science, and high school students. We came together through passion for making the biological sciences and related technologies more accessible to everyone. Following this spirit, we aim to ensure that all of our projects are open source, shatter existing barriers for entry, and can be easily replicated by anyone with a tenacious spirit and appetite for DIY. 

Our opinion of the current landscape of biotechnology is that there two primary barriers. The first is cost, and the second is knowledge. Through these projects, we aim to lower these barriers in two ways:

* First, all of our projects will be low-cost. While we understand "low-cost" is relative, we can promise that each of our projects will be significantly cheaper to replicate, with little to no sacrifice in quality, compared to purchasing existing commercial items. 

* Second, we will always be sure to document and share our design process throughout each and every project. This will often include presentations which will provide the necessary and comprehensive background to understand the scope, purpose, and value of the project. 

As a group, we are excited to share our projects with anyone whom shares our passion for creating, lowering traditional barriers, and increasing accessibility to the biological sciences. Please feel free to contact us with any questions, concerns, design improvements, or kudos. We'd love to hear from you!
